The idea of the application is to allow users to post to the main page like a bulletin board. The core of the bulletin board spirit is self-entertainment, personal freedom of expression. And it can also share and help others. The bulletin board will combine text, images, links to other blogs or websites, and other related media.

**Core Features:**

Home page: Brief explanation of features/ the website

Main page: Show all posts

Post page: Allow user to post text and images, allow user to delete their posts

Profile page: Show userâ€™s profile, show the list of all the user's posts
